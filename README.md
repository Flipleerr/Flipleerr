Yo, I’m @Flipleerr!

I'm Serbian and I make shitty Python programs

I also try out other stuff like JS from time to time XD

Feel free to reach out to theflipleerr@gmail.com or here for PULL REQUESTS and other stuff.

You can also branch and use my stuff (just make sure to credit me!) without the need for donations or commissions

Check out my YT channel too! https://youtube.com/channel/UCHo9ztfBRTF4ehEiT6FqTeA
